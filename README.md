# Welcome to the JavaScript Carnival!

## Summary

The JavaScript Carnival is a collection of three code challenges that I completed in week 3 of foundations in Dev Academy to practice my vanilla Javascript skills.

## The Games

[Inflate The Unicorn](./inflate-the-unicorn/inflate-the-unicorn-README.md)  
These poor unicorns have balloons for horns. Write code that inflates them!

[Whack-A-Mole](./whack-a-mole/whack-a-mole-README.md)  
The carnival classic "Whack a Mole" brought to life right inside your very own web browser. Where did all the moles go?

[Dress The Clown](./dress-the-clown/dress-the-clown-README.md)  
A dress-up game where you make a clown look fancy!
